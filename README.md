Programming Ability Test -- Zhejiang University

PAT(http://pat.zju.edu.cn) was organized by the Computer Science and Technology of Zhejiang University. It aims to 
develop the students' ability of analyzing problems, solve problems and programming.

The test contains 4 problems described by English or Chinese in general, and you should complete them during the
